b) For checking smaller groups of data (less than 5000 items):

Trees:
-Advantages:
    1) None, trees were always slower.
-Disadvantages:
    1) Insertion time is slower for larger number of items
    2) Find time is slower for larger number of items
    
Hash Table:
-Advantages:
    1) Insertion Time is faster for larger number of items
    2) Find time is faster for larger number of items
-Disadvantages:
    1) None, hash table was always faster

I would also like to compare the two data structures on even smaller numbers
of items. Trees might perform better than hash tables in this case. However,
I think hash tables will still perform better at even larger groups of data
(more than 5000 items). I would also like to compare the deletion time
between trees and hash tables.
